# WordInk Program Roadmap - Plan

## Goal Capsule

- **Objective:** a single program-level view of what WordInk ships next, in Now / Next / Later order, with status, evidence, difficulty, feasibility and a simpler alternative for every unit. It sits above the per-phase plans in `docs/plans/` and does not replace them.
- **Product authority:** Luke (`duketopceo`). Two decisions below are marked **owner decision** and this plan does not make them: whether to build a standalone desktop app (U9), and whether to merge the Argus reviewer PR (U4).
- **Evidence date:** 2026-10-10, from `master` at `7057304`, GitHub PR/issue state, `gh run list`, `npm view` and the repo's own checks (all green locally, see Verification Contract).
- **Out of scope:** application code. This pass changes docs and brand assets only. Code lands from the units below.

---

## Product Contract

### Summary

WordInk is dictation as a component: a Rust sans-I/O core compiled to WebAssembly (75.8 KB raw / 34.7 KB gzip against a 150 KB budget), a TypeScript browser host, `<wordink-mic>`, a React hook, an in-browser local engine (Moonshine), a fail-closed credential relay and an OpenAI-compatible desktop gateway in `@wordink/server`, plus a Python CLI and MCP server in `sdks/python`.

### Problem Frame

Phases 0, 1, 2 (integration route) and 4 (Python) are merged to `master`. The docs site is live (HTTP 200). Three things still stop it being a product people can adopt:

- **Nothing is on npm.** `npm view @wordink/web version` returns 404. The release workflow is dormant because the `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED` repository variable is unset, and the "Version Packages" PR (#32) is open.
- **`master` CI is red.** The `e2e` job failed on the merge of #36 (`apps/docs/e2e/demo.spec.ts`: `#demo-text` stayed empty).
- **The repo contradicts itself.** `ROADMAP.md` says Phase 2 chose integration and Phase 3 is dropped, while issues #13 and #14 still describe a standalone app, issue #8 (U5) is open though its PR merged, and the README says a desktop app comes "later".

### Requirements

- R1. Every unit carries a stable U-ID, a status with evidence, Difficulty, Feasibility and a Simpler alternative.
- R2. Phase 2 desktop options are recorded with difficulty and feasibility, and no option is selected here.
- R3. The `WF-WRITE` audit finding is resolved to a named workflow and a verdict, without changing any workflow.
- R4. Landscape claims trace to `docs/research/2026-10-10-landscape.md`.

### Phase 2 desktop options (owner decision, not made here)

The repo's `ROADMAP.md` records Option A as chosen and shipped (the gateway and `/v1/models` are on `master` (PR #29), and Voxtype on the owner's machine dictates through it). The owner's own notes treat the desktop direction as still open, so this plan records the options and marks the remaining choice as the owner's.

| Option | What it is | Difficulty | Feasibility and blockers |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. Integrate (state per ROADMAP: done) | `wordink-gateway` as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; Voxtype remote mode; TypeWhisper via its OpenAI-compatible engine. | Easy to extend (each new client is a docs page plus a smoke test) | Works today. Limits: depends on third-party apps keeping their OpenAI-compatible engines; TypeWhisper has no Linux build and is GPLv3, so a bundled plugin would carry GPL terms; Voxtype's remote option is only described as "remote Whisper servers" on its site, so the exact protocol needs re-checking per release. |
| A+. Add more clients to A | Handy, OpenWhispr, hyprwhspr, whisrs, Spokenly (all listed in `ROADMAP.md` as supporting local/BYOK or cloud engines) get gateway recipes. | Easy to medium | Needs per-app verification on each OS; some may lack a custom-endpoint setting. |
| B. Standalone Linux app | Native host for the Rust core: portal global shortcuts, virtual-keyboard injection, tray. | Hard | Wayland has no universal global-hotkey or text-injection API (portals, compositor binds, `wtype`/`ydotool` each work on a subset); competes directly with Voxtype (MIT, 8 engines, GPU); needs packaging (AUR, Omarchy). |
| B'. Standalone Windows/macOS app (issue #14) | Same app elsewhere, replacing `legacy/`. | Hard | macOS accessibility permission flow and signed, notarized builds need an Apple Developer account; Windows signing costs money; competes with Wispr Flow, Superwhisper, TypeWhisper. |
| C. Skip desktop | All effort into the SDK, Python, mobile and provider hardening. | Easy (it is a scope decision) | Drops the desktop story; the gateway stays as a supported but frozen surface. |

**Owner decision (U9):** choose among A-only, A+, B, B' or C, or keep A and revisit on adoption data. Until then no desktop code is planned beyond A/A+.

### `WF-WRITE` audit finding

Workflows with write permissions, and whether each needs it:

| Workflow | Write scope | Needed? |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`, job `version` | `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Yes. `changesets/action` pushes the version branch and opens the "Version Packages" PR. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`, job `publish` | `contents: write`, `id-token: write` | Yes. Pushes release tags; `id-token` is the OIDC exchange for npm trusted publishing and provenance. Job is dormant until `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED=true`. |
| `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, job `deploy` | `pages: write`, `id-token: write` | Yes. Required by `actions/deploy-pages`. |
| `ci.yml` | `contents: read` only | n/a |
| `argus-mention.yml` (in open PR #35, not on `master`) | `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `checks: write`, `statuses: write` | Only if the owner wants `@argus persist`, `generate` or `fix`, which commit to an `argus/` branch. For review-only use it can drop to `contents: read`. It triggers on `issue_comment` with a secret present and only checks that the comment starts with `@argus`; it has no author-association check, so on a public repo any commenter could trigger a run that spends the OpenRouter key. |
| `argus-reviewer.yml` (PR #35) | `contents: read`, plus `issues`/`pull-requests`/`checks`/`statuses: write` | Writes are for review comments and checks; `contents` is already read-only. Acceptable. |

The most likely referent of the audit's `WF-WRITE` flag is `argus-mention.yml` (the only workflow whose write scope is optional). The three existing `master` workflows need what they request. Recommendation recorded for the owner under U4; no workflow is changed in this pass.

### Scope Boundaries

- No application code, workflow or lockfile changes in this pass.
- Phase 3 (standalone Windows and macOS app) stays "dropped" in `ROADMAP.md` unless U9 reopens it.

---

## Planning Contract

### Key Technical Decisions

- KTD1. Order by what unblocks adoption: green CI, then npm, then truth in the docs and backlog, then new capability.
- KTD2. Every unit names a simpler alternative so scope can be cut instead of added.
- KTD3. Decisions that change product identity (desktop app, bot review spend) stay with the owner.

### Dependencies / Assumptions

- Operator-only steps (npm org, trusted publishing, repo variable, merging) cannot be done by an agent; units say so.
- Pricing figures in the research note come from vendor pages and aggregators and drift.

## Implementation Units

### Now

#### U1. Make `master` CI green again

- **Status:** open. Evidence: `gh run list` shows CI on `master` failing at `7057304` (job `e2e`: `apps/docs/e2e/demo.spec.ts` expects `#demo-text` not empty; the three other jobs pass). The same suite passes on the branch run of #36.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Difficulty:** easy to medium. The failure is one test; the cause (flaky fake-mic or wasm timing versus a real regression) is unknown until reproduced.
- **Feasibility:** CI-only risk. Firefox needs the PulseAudio null sink already in `ci.yml`. See `docs/solutions/test-failures/chromium-fake-mic-loops-from-launch.md` for a related past failure.
- **Simpler alternative:** re-run the job and compare; if it is a timing flake, widen the assertion timeout in `apps/docs/e2e/demo.spec.ts` rather than restructuring the demo.
- **Verification:** three consecutive green `master` CI runs; `pnpm test:e2e` locally.

#### U2. Take `@wordink/*` live on npm

- **Status:** not started. Evidence: `npm view @wordink/web version` is 404; `gh variable list` shows no `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED`; PR #32 (version packages, core 0.1.0) is open. Procedure is already written in `.github/workflows/release.yml` header and `docs/plans/2026-10-06-1603-feat-phase-1-closeout-plan.md` U6.
- **Dependencies:** U1 (publish job runs `pnpm test`).
- **Difficulty:** medium. Mostly account work; the pipeline exists.
- **Feasibility:** blocked on the owner: the `@wordink` npm scope may be unclaimable (the closeout plan has a fallback to unscoped names), each package must exist before trusted publishing can be attached, and 2FA is required. No agent can complete it.
- **Simpler alternative:** publish a first version by hand to create the packages, then let CI do every later release. The README's CDN quickstart (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@wordink/web@VERSION`) depends on this unit.
- **Verification:** `npm view @wordink/{core,web,react,local,server} version` all resolve; provenance badge present; a clean `npm install @wordink/web` works.

#### U3. Reconcile backlog and docs with reality

- **Status:** open. Evidence: issues #4-#12 are U1-U9 tracking issues (only #8 still open though PR #19 merged); #13 and #14 describe a standalone app that `ROADMAP.md` says was not chosen or dropped; #15 mixes the built Python work with mobile. `README.md` says a desktop app comes "later"; `AGENTS.md` says "A desktop app comes later" and that `legacy/` stays until "WordInk Desktop" replaces it.
- **Dependencies:** none (U9 may change the wording).
- **Difficulty:** easy.
- **Feasibility:** none; needs owner approval to close issues.
- **Simpler alternative:** one tracking issue per roadmap unit and close the rest, instead of keeping phase-shaped issues.
- **Verification:** `gh issue list` matches this plan's units; README and AGENTS.md agree with `ROADMAP.md`.

#### U4. Decide the Argus reviewer PR and its write scope (owner decision)

- **Status:** open. Evidence: PR #35 adds `argus-reviewer.yml`, `argus-mention.yml`, `argus-reviewer.config.ts` and a smoke test; needs an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` secret; default budget $1/run.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Difficulty:** easy.
- **Feasibility:** spend must go through the dedicated OpenRouter key per `AGENTS.md` of the owner's workspace; see the `WF-WRITE` table for the `argus-mention.yml` issues.
- **Simpler alternative:** merge only `argus-reviewer.yml` (read-only contents) and skip `argus-mention.yml`, or add an `author_association` guard and drop `contents: write` first.
- **Verification:** after merge, a test PR gets a review comment; a comment from a non-collaborator does not trigger a run.

### Next

#### U5. Live-verify the OpenAI and Deepgram adapters

- **Status:** deferred in `ROADMAP.md`. Evidence: unit tests pass; the open questions are OpenAI GA session shape, `gpt-live-transcribe`, `ek_` auth, and Deepgram `token` versus `bearer`. OpenAI's current docs list `gpt-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` and `whisper-1` (see research note), so model names in `packages/server/src/openai.ts` need re-checking.
- **Dependencies:** none; U2 for any release.
- **Difficulty:** medium.
- **Feasibility:** needs provider keys and small spend; use the `orch` wrapper and the dedicated key only.
- **Simpler alternative:** make Groq (the default, `whisper-large-v3-turbo` at $0.04/hour) the only guaranteed provider and mark the others "experimental" in `apps/docs/pages/providers.md` instead of verifying.
- **Verification:** one recorded live run per provider; doc page states verified date.

#### U6. Cross-browser blur and permission handcheck

- **Status:** deferred. Evidence: Playwright covers Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with fake mics; the manual blur/permission pass on real devices (Safari, iOS) is not recorded.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Difficulty:** easy.
- **Feasibility:** needs a Mac and an iPhone.
- **Simpler alternative:** document Safari/iOS as "best effort" and publish the handcheck as a checklist in `packages/web/README.md`.
- **Verification:** checklist filled with date and device.

#### U7. Python SDK: CI and distribution

- **Status:** built, not gated. Evidence: `sdks/python` (`client.py`, `cli.py`, `mcp_server.py`); its plan (KTD5) leaves CI as a follow-up; CI has no Python SDK job.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Difficulty:** easy.
- **Feasibility:** PyPI name availability for `wordink` is unchecked.
- **Simpler alternative:** ship via `uvx --from git+https://github.com/duketopceo/WordInk#subdirectory=sdks/python wordink` and skip PyPI.
- **Verification:** a `uv run pytest` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (change to be made in this unit, not now).

#### U8. Retire or freeze `legacy/`

- **Status:** open. Evidence: `legacy/wordink/*.py` is about 2,000 lines of Windows-only Python; `AGENTS.md` keeps it "until WordInk Desktop replaces it"; Phase 3 is dropped, so that replacement is not coming unless U9 says so; CI runs a `legacy` job on every PR.
- **Dependencies:** U9 (if the owner picks B or B', keep it until the replacement exists).
- **Difficulty:** easy.
- **Feasibility:** the legacy data directory `~/.groq_flow/` is user data and must not be renamed; the MIT credit to groq_flow must stay in `LICENSE`.
- **Simpler alternative:** move it to a `legacy` branch/tag and delete the directory plus the `legacy` job; or just drop the CI job and mark the directory unmaintained.
- **Verification:** CI green without the job; README layout table updated.

#### U9. Desktop direction (owner decision)

- **Status:** owner decision. Evidence: Phase 2 options table above; `ROADMAP.md` records A as decided.
- **Dependencies:** U2 (adoption data needs a published package).
- **Difficulty:** see the table.
- **Feasibility:** see the table.
- **Simpler alternative:** A+ (more client recipes) costs days; B costs months.
- **Verification:** the chosen option is written into `ROADMAP.md` and issues #13/#14 are closed or rewritten (U3).

### Later

#### U10. Hosted-quality cleanup presets

- **Status:** not started. Evidence: `transform` hook exists and is documented (`apps/docs/pages/transform.md`); Wispr Flow, Superwhisper and TypeWhisper all ship LLM cleanup modes (research note).
- **Dependencies:** U2.
- **Difficulty:** medium.
- **Feasibility:** per-request LLM cost and latency; must stay off by default and route through the relay so keys never reach the browser.
- **Simpler alternative:** keep `transform` and publish two ready-made relay recipes in `examples/server-node`.
- **Verification:** demo shows before/after on a messy sample.

#### U11. Stronger local engine

- **Status:** not started. Evidence: `packages/local` wraps Moonshine in a worker; alternatives are Whisper via whisper.cpp WASM or transformers.js.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Difficulty:** medium.
- **Feasibility:** model download size, WebGPU support differences across browsers, licence of each model.
- **Simpler alternative:** keep Moonshine; add a documented `provider` hook so adopters bring their own engine.
- **Verification:** word-error-rate comparison on a fixed clip set.

#### U12. Mobile SDK (React Native / native)

- **Status:** deferred by demand (issue #15).
- **Dependencies:** U2 and adoption data.
- **Difficulty:** hard.
- **Feasibility:** the Rust core is sans-I/O so it can be reused, but every platform needs its own audio and text-insertion host.
- **Simpler alternative:** none needed until requested; the web component already works in mobile browsers where `getUserMedia` does.
- **Verification:** a sample app dictating into a text field on iOS and Android.

#### U13. Standalone desktop app

- **Status:** conditional on U9; not planned.
- **Dependencies:** U9.
- **Difficulty:** hard.
- **Feasibility:** see Option B/B'.
- **Simpler alternative:** U9 option A+.
- **Verification:** defined only if U9 selects it.

### Simplifications found

- **`legacy/`** is the biggest removable piece (about 2,000 lines of Python plus a CI job) and is not part of the product.
- **Phase-shaped issues #4-#14** duplicate this plan and can be closed.
- **`wordink-wasm`** exists only to expose the core to JS; there is no evidence it needs simplifying, so it is left alone.

`pnpm test:e2e` and the `legacy` job were not run locally; U1 covers the CI e2e failure.

## Definition of Done

- This plan is listed first in `ROADMAP.md` and links to `docs/research/2026-10-10-landscape.md` and `DESIGN.md`.
- The owner has seen the two decisions (U4, U9) and the logo proposal.
